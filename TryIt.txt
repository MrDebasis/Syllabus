
Chimeric antigen receptor(kaimerik enteejan riseptar) T-cell therapy, also known as CAR T-cell therapy, is a type of immunotherapy that uses genetically modified T cells to treat cancer. 

Collecting T cells (Apheresis)
A needle is inserted into a vein in the patient's arm to remove blood, which is then passed through a machine that separates the different blood components. The T cells are extracted from the blood and sent to a lab

Engineering the T cells
The T cells are modified in the lab to produce chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their surface. CARs are synthetic molecules that bind to specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells. 

Infusing the patient (Infusion)
The CAR T cells are multiplied in the lab and then infused back into the patient. Once inside the body, the CAR T cells continue to multiply and attack cancer cells.
