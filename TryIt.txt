During our monthly check-ins, he consistently clarified the steps, processes, and next actions, which greatly helped me navigate my responsibilities and understand how things work. This structured approach has been incredibly beneficial for my growth.

As a frontend resource, he continuously encourages me to explore out-of-the-box features and stay updated with new releases. This motivation has helped me expand my knowledge and implement innovative solutions in my work.

Fearless Communication in Client Calls:
He has provided me with opportunities to raise my questions during client-facing calls, helping me build confidence and encouraging me to express my ideas fearlessly. This has greatly enhanced my communication skills and interaction with stakeholders.

Providing Adequate Time for Task Completion:
He ensures I have enough time and space to complete my tasks perfectly. This trust and flexibility have allowed me to focus on quality and improve my work efficiency.

Estimating Frontend Stories:
