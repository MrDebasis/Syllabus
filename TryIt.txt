At J&J, I led 70% of the design for the Experience Site Portal, creating dynamic, reusable components that enhanced development efficiency and consistency. Delivered User Stories ahead of deadlines and refactored the codebase dynamically, ensuring no blockers or defects in FIT, UAT, and BST cycles. Owned key functionalities like Header/Footer, Add/Submit Expense, Edit Expense, OCR Integration, Notification Center, and Lazy Loading. Executed impactful POCs that drove project growth, resolved mobile CSS issues during FIT, and led mobile testing on a borrowed Mac. Achieved zero-defect implementations across sprint testing and UAT cycles, demonstrating robust development practices and collaboration.

For GP, I enhanced the Subscription List View UI/UX, designed comprehensive HLD/LLD diagrams, and delivered POCs that unlocked future User Stories. Conducted successful KT sessions, resolved critical FIT integration issues, and supported the testing team with ACR scenarios. Refactored major functionalities and took ownership of key features like Unsubscribe/Resubscribe and Notification History, achieving bug-free performance and recognition for my contributions.
