I recently participated in testing Codify, an internal tool at Deloitte. During the testing phase, I provided detailed feedback and suggestions for improvement. Based on this feedback, some significant updates and releases were made to enhance the tool's functionality. I dedicated a considerable amount of time to this process, and it was a great experience contributing to the refinement of such a valuable resource.
