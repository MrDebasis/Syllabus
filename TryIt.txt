We identified some observations during development that were not covered in the testing scope:

[Issue 1]: [Brief description].
[Issue 2]: [Brief description].
[Issue 3]: [Brief description].
I’ve informed the testing team to include these scenarios in their scope and keep a track of them. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to address.
